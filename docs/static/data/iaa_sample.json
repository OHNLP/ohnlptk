{"ann":{"3456794693807909":{"anns":[{"text":"CC: weakness x 1 day\n\nHPI: BA is a 62 year old woman with a past medical history of multiple TIAs, subarachnoid hemorrhages, seizures, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with new onset weakness and altered mental status in the last 24 hours. The patient states that she got up in the morning to use the restroom, and she was staggering like she was “drunk” or “drugged.” The patient’s niece, who lives with her, said that the patient’s speech was slowed and she was more confused than her baseline. The patient does have some baseline left sided weakness and facial nerve palsy from previous cerebrovascular events, however she is normally able to perform ADLs.\n\nThe patient also endorses dizziness and some lightheadedness. She denies current headache, but states that she gets headaches 3-4x/wk that are associated with photophobia. She denies vision changes and neck pain. The patient has a history of seizures, but denies any seizure like activity at this time with no loss of consciousness, no convulsions, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. Of note, the patient is on 35 units of lantus qHS and missed her dose the night prior to admission. She reports having some difficulty remembering to take her home medications.\n\nROS:\n\nGeneral: +fatigue;  fever\nHead:  headache, dizziness, trauma\nEyes:  vision changes\nCV:  chest pain, palpitations\nPulm:  cough,  SOB\nGI: +nausea, flank pain;  vomiting, diarrhea, constipation\nUrinary:  dysuria, polyuria\nMusculoskeletal: +chronic hip and back pain\nNeurologic: +weakness,  loss of sensation\nEndocrine: +cold intolerance\nSkin:  rashes, lesions\nPMHx: TIAs (several in mid 2000s), SAH, most recently in 9/15, Seizures, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension\n\nPSurgHx: Cerebral aneurysm repair & Hysterectomy in 1995\n\nFamHx: DM in multiple unspecified relatives\n\nSocHx: Her niece lives with her part time. Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n \n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n","dtd_name":"NounVerbTask","tags":[{"tag":"NOUN","id":"N0","spans":"47~52","text":"woman","type":"other","comment":"default
