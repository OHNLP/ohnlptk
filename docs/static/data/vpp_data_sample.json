The patient states that she got up in the morning to use the restroom, and she was staggering like she was “drunk” or “drugged.” The patient’s niece, who lives with her, said that the patient’s speech was slowed and she was more confused than her baseline. The patient does have some baseline left sided weakness and facial nerve palsy from previous cerebrovascular events, however she is normally able to perform ADLs.\n\nThe patient also endorses dizziness and some lightheadedness. She denies current headache, but states that she gets headaches 3-4x/wk that are associated with photophobia. She denies vision changes and neck pain. The patient has a history of seizures, but denies any seizure like activity at this time with no loss of consciousness, no convulsions, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. Of note, the patient is on 35 units of lantus qHS and missed her dose the night prior to admission. She reports having some difficulty remembering to take her home medications.\n\nROS:\n\nGeneral: +fatigue;  fever\nHead:  headache, dizziness, trauma\nEyes:  vision changes\nCV:  chest pain, palpitations\nPulm:  cough,  SOB\nGI: +nausea, flank pain;  vomiting, diarrhea, constipation\nUrinary:  dysuria, polyuria\nMusculoskeletal: +chronic hip and back pain\nNeurologic: +weakness,  loss of sensation\nEndocrine: +cold intolerance\nSkin:  rashes, lesions\nPMHx: TIAs (several in mid 2000s), SAH, most recently in 9/15, Seizures, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension\n\nPSurgHx: Cerebral aneurysm repair & Hysterectomy in 1995\n\nFamHx: DM in multiple unspecified relatives\n\nSocHx: Her niece lives with her part time. Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

            "text": "CC: weakness x 1 day\n\nHPI: BA is a 62 year old woman with a past medical history of multiple TIAs, subarachnoid hemorrhages, seizures, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with new onset weakness and altered mental status in the last 24 hours. The patient states that she got up in the morning to use the restroom, and she was staggering like she was “drunk” or “drugged.” The patient’s niece, who lives with her, said that the patient’s speech was slowed and she was more confused than her baseline. The patient does have some baseline left sided weakness and facial nerve palsy from previous cerebrovascular events, however she is normally able to perform ADLs.\n\nThe patient also endorses dizziness and some lightheadedness. She denies current headache, but states that she gets headaches 3-4x/wk that are associated with photophobia. She denies vision changes and neck pain. The patient has a history of seizures, but denies any seizure like activity at this time with no loss of consciousness, no convulsions, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. Of note, the patient is on 35 units of lantus qHS and missed her dose the night prior to admission. She reports having some difficulty remembering to take her home medications.\n\nROS:\n\nGeneral: +fatigue;  fever\nHead:  headache, dizziness, trauma\nEyes:  vision changes\nCV:  chest pain, palpitations\nPulm:  cough,  SOB\nGI: +nausea, flank pain;  vomiting, diarrhea, constipation\nUrinary:  dysuria, polyuria\nMusculoskeletal: +chronic hip and back pain\nNeurologic: +weakness,  loss of sensation\nEndocrine: +cold intolerance\nSkin:  rashes, lesions\nPMHx: TIAs (several in mid 2000s), SAH, most recently in 9/15, Seizures, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension\n\nPSurgHx: Cerebral aneurysm repair & Hysterectomy in 1995\n\nFamHx: DM in multiple unspecified relatives\n\nSocHx: Her niece lives with her part time. Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.

The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient states that she got up in the morning to use the restroom, and she was staggering like she was “drunk” or “drugged.” The patient’s niece, who lives with her, said that the patient’s speech was slowed and she was more confused than her baseline. The patient does have some baseline left sided weakness and facial nerve palsy from previous cerebrovascular events, however she is normally able to perform ADLs.\n\nThe patient also endorses dizziness and some lightheadedness. She denies current headache, but states that she gets headaches 3-4x/wk that are associated with photophobia. She denies vision changes and neck pain. The patient has a history of seizures, but denies any seizure like activity at this time with no loss of consciousness, no convulsions, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. Of note, the patient is on 35 units of lantus qHS and missed her dose the night prior to admission. She reports having some difficulty remembering to take her home medications.\n\nROS:\n\nGeneral: +fatigue;  fever\nHead:  headache, dizziness, trauma\nEyes:  vision changes\nCV:  chest pain, palpitations\nPulm:  cough,  SOB\nGI: +nausea, flank pain;  vomiting, diarrhea, constipation\nUrinary:  dysuria, polyuria\nMusculoskeletal: +chronic hip and back pain\nNeurologic: +weakness,  loss of sensation\nEndocrine: +cold intolerance\nSkin:  rashes, lesions\nPMHx: TIAs (several in mid 2000s), SAH, most recently in 9/15, Seizures, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension\n\nPSurgHx: Cerebral aneurysm repair & Hysterectomy in 1995\n\nFamHx: DM in multiple unspecified relatives\n\nSocHx: Her niece lives with her part time. Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient states that she got up in the morning to use the restroom, and she was staggering like she was “drunk” or “drugged.” The patient’s niece, who lives with her, said that the patient’s speech was slowed and she was more confused than her baseline. The patient does have some baseline left sided weakness and facial nerve palsy from previous cerebrovascular events, however she is normally able to perform ADLs.\n\nThe patient also endorses dizziness and some lightheadedness. She denies current headache, but states that she gets headaches 3-4x/wk that are associated with photophobia. She denies vision changes and neck pain. The patient has a history of seizures, but denies any seizure like activity at this time with no loss of consciousness, no convulsions, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. Of note, the patient is on 35 units of lantus qHS and missed her dose the night prior to admission. She reports having some difficulty remembering to take her home medications.\n\nROS:\n\nGeneral: +fatigue;  fever\nHead:  headache, dizziness, trauma\nEyes:  vision changes\nCV:  chest pain, palpitations\nPulm:  cough,  SOB\nGI: +nausea, flank pain;  vomiting, diarrhea, constipation\nUrinary:  dysuria, polyuria\nMusculoskeletal: +chronic hip and back pain\nNeurologic: +weakness,  loss of sensation\nEndocrine: +cold intolerance\nSkin:  rashes, lesions\nPMHx: TIAs (several in mid 2000s), SAH, most recently in 9/15, Seizures, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension\n\nPSurgHx: Cerebral aneurysm repair & Hysterectomy in 1995\n\nFamHx: DM in multiple unspecified relatives\n\nSocHx: Her niece lives with her part time. Denies alcohol use, former smoker (30 pack years, quit 1993), denies illicit drug use\n\nHome Medications: Amlodipine 10mg QD, Labetalol 100mg BID, Atorvastatin 40mg QD, Phenytoin 300mg qHS, Novolog 10 units with meals, Lantus 35 units qHS, Levothyroxine 75mcg qD, Flexeril 5mg TID, Gabapentin 800mg BID\n\nAllergies: contrast dye (anaphylaxis)\n\n \n\nVitals at Admission\n\nT: 97.3\nHR: 87\nBP: 185/105\nResp: 18\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\n \n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: somnolent. Oriented to person and place.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non distended. Moderate tenderness over left abdomen and flank.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop. Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right. No sensory deficits. Speech is slowed. Coordination is slowed. Unable to complete assessment of attention due to mental status.\n \n\nLabs and Studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.4, Hb 12.2, Plts 179\n\nBMP: Na 130, K 4.6, Cl 99, Bicarb 25, BUN 18, Cr 1.08, Gluc 519, Ca 9.9, Phos 2.8\n\nLFTs: TP 7.7, Alb 4.1, Tbili 0.3, ALT 13, AST 15, AlkPhos 110\n\nLipids: TC 305, TG 202, HDL 44, LDL 221\n\nThyroid: TSH 16.04, free T4: 0.57\n\nUA: glucose >500\n\nCT Head: no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event\n\n\nAssessment & Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Differential diagnosis for the patient’s current complaints is widespread and includes CVA, encephalitis, hyperglycemia, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure, and phenytoin toxicity. No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

No acute changes on head CT rules out a stroke and the patient is not demonstrating any signs of infection (no fever, no elevated WBC, no headache/neck pain). The leading consideration at this point would be related to missed doses of medications, given lab valves of glucose and thyroid hormone, or perhaps overdose of muscle relaxant medications. Patient should also be tested for phenytoin toxicity. Control glucose and hypertension as described below. Phenytoin level pending as supra therapeutic levels can lead to altered mental status. Continue to assess level of orientation.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Given the patient’s glucose of 519 and HbA1c of 11 last year, her diabetes is not well controlled, and occasionally misses doses. Repeat HbA1c. Continue home Lantus 35 units qHs and aspart 10 TID. Refer for diabetes education.\n HTN: BP 180s/100s initially, decreased to 140s/90s during ED course. Continue home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: TSH 16 (previously 25 in 7/2015). Continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM\nSeizure Disorder: The patient denies any symptoms resembling her past seizures (staring, automatisms) and any loss of consciousness. Unclear if she is taking phenytoin consistently. Continue home phenytoin 300mg qHs. Phenytoin level pending.\nSAH: The patient denies symptoms resembling her prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (“thunderclap headache”) and current symptoms are not consistent with SAH. CT Brain does not show acute bleed.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/2015 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.\n \n\n\n\nSOAP Note (daily note for above patient)\n\nHospital Day #3\n\nS: Patient did not have any complaints overnight. She was able to tolerate his meals without any difficulty swallowing. She reports feeling less confused today. Denies having fever/chills overnight.\n\nO:\n\nVitals\n\nT: 98.1\nHR: 77-91\nBP: 137-165/88-105\nResp: 18-22\nO2 Sats: 100% on room air\n\nGeneral: more alert today.. Oriented x 3.\nHEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No oral lesions, no lymphadenopathy\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nGI: Normal bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended. No guarding or rebound.\nExtremities: No swelling, good peripheral pulses.\nNeuro: Left facial droop (unchanged). Strength 4/5 in LUE and LLE and 5/5 in right (unchanged). No sensory deficits. Speech and coordination are still slow but improved from yesterday. Reflexes normal. Able to feed herself and ambulate to bathroom.\n \n\nLabs & studies\n\nCBC: WBC 4.2, Hb 12.1, Plts 163\n\nBMP: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 101, HCO3 25, BUN/Cr 14/1.04, Gluc 185, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.1\n\nCSF results from yesterday: no bacteria, 3 WBC, no RBCs, CSF RPR negative\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nWeakness/AMS: Given the normal results on CT, BMP, lumbar puncture, and largely normal vitals, I believe that the patient’s weakness may have been due to hyperglycemia causing a re-expression of her previous strokes. The weakness and mental status have improved with correction of glucose levels and are back to the patient’s previous baseline.\nDiabetes Mellitus: Increased Lantus to 40 units qHs which has improved CBGs. This will most likely be a new home dose for the patient.\nHTN: improved after resuming home amlodipine 10 daily and labetalol 100 BID.\nHypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine 75mcg qAM. No sx of hypothyroid.\nSeizure Disorder: Continue phenytoin 300mg QD as phenytoin level is therapeutic.\nSAH: stable, no acute changes on CT.\nBell’s Palsy: Diagnosed in 7/15 after shingles. Condition is stable; no acute changes. Continue to monitor for any changes in facial palsy.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient is taking medications as blood like thinner and for osteoporosis. She has allergies previously to grass and dust mites. She always has a wet nose when having allergies and does a nose drop and cleaner. Her nose was always on the runny side, she cannot live without a tissue. She uses a nasal spray and the cleaner. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), lisinopril, amlodipine, simvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) as blood thinner and paracetamol (TYLENOL ARTHRITIS) for osteoporosis. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 she had little soreness and had no other symptoms. The patient was asking if she should stop taking the BABY ASPIRIN and TYLENOL ARTHRITIS now that she got the vaccine. She read some place one should not take any aspirin. The case was reported as non-serious. The outcome of the event was unknown.",

A female patient of an unspecified age (age: 19, units: unknown) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",
